# FAQ

## How do I find old content?

Select the top-level folder (under xmlsource in Perforce) for your content. Select one or more folders that contain ditamaps for the content you're interested in. You can also use the **Comparison** tab **Portal Freshness** vizualization if you want to easily see all the content in a top-level folder.

# Visualizations

**Freshness:** Allows you to view the freshness of files in a folder. This is the last time the file was modified on the client, before it was submitted to the Perforce server. So this is the last time a person touched the file. For information about multiple domains, see the **Comparison** menu Portal Freshness visualization.
