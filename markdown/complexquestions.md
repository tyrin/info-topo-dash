# FAQ

## How can I see term or concept connections across salesforce?

You can search across all of the connected files in Perforce by whether the term is in the page title (labels) or the file path (nodes). For example, if you search for "import" in labels, it will return anything that has labels in the title. If you search for "import" in node, it will return any file that has labels in the filename or in any folder. This allows you to examine files in the same category as your term, even if they don't directly contain the term in the title.
**Note:** you may want to use a partial term, such as _integ_ to catch multiple variations of a term, such as 'integrator', 'integrate', and 'integrating'.
